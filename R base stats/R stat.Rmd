## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
#Basic statistical Calculations
weight <- c(60,72,57,90,95,72)
class (weight)
height <- c(1.75,1.80,1.65,1.90,1.74,1.91)
data.frame(weight,height)
summary(data.frame(weight,height))
summary(weight)
summary(height)
mean(weight)
mean(height)
max(weight)
max(height)
min(weight)
min(height)
median(weight)
median(height)
```

# comparision of means of different groups
employees_weight<- c(56,67,65,78,49,87,55,63,70,72,79,52,60,78,90)
employees_weight
employees_gender<- c(1,1,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,2)
# Using tapply function
tapply(employees_weight,employees_gender,mean)
tapply(employees_weight,employees_gender,max)
tapply(employees_weight,employees_gender,min)
tapply(employees_weight,employees_gender,summary)


aggregate(employees_weight~employees_gender, FUN = mean)
